Description: This program will be implementing the basic algorithm of seam carving which can shrink an image 
	    (horizontally and/or vertically) to a given dimension.

Base code: I will use instructor's code as a base for this assignment. 
Reminder: This program may take long time to finish seam carving for the large image with small dimension input.
